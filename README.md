# Java TicTacToe

This is currently a test program for a command line Java Tic Tac Toe game. As of writing this, I am curious about better programming conventions and this has been my first time using JavaDoc. This project is still being worked on as of writing this, but I am of course open to comments and suggestions. Thanks for viewing.
