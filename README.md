# Java TicTacToe

This is currently a test program for a command line Java Tic Tac Toe game. This porject will also encourage me to become more familiar with using GitHub to manage my project and stay organized. As of writing this, I am curious about better programming conventions and this has also been my first time using JavaDoc. This project is still being worked on as of writing this, but I am of course open to comments and suggestions. Thanks for viewing.
